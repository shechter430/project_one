<br />This project utilized a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who) from kaggle.com to explore life expectancy in developing countries. The dataset was complied from information on the WHO and United Nations websites. The project collaborators specifically wanted to look at how certain factors such as early-life vaccinations, schooling and GDP affected life expectancy. A research hypothesis was proposed as well as three specific research questions: 
><br />*Hypothesis - Average life expectancy amongst countries is affected by socioeconomic factors such as early vaccination, GDP, and schooling.*
<br />Research Q1 - Do early life vaccinations affect average life expectancy in developing countries?
<br />Research Q2 - Does increased schooling positively correlated with increased life expectancy?
<br />Research Q3 - Are average life expectancy and infant deaths affected by GDP in developing countries?
<br />
<br />In order to answer these questions and test the hypothesis, a mulitple regressions were ran comparing variables listed in the hypothesis. All regressions showed mild to strong correlations between variables therefore supporting the research questions and hypothesis.
