# **Life Expectancy: A Statistical Analysis** 
---
### <p>Project 1<br>
#### Collaborators: Anna Sanchez, Jennifer Reyna and Shondeen Hechter<p>

<br />This project utilized a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who) from kaggle.com to explore life expectancy in developing countries. The project collaborators specifically wanted to look at how certain factors such as early-life vaccinations, schooling and GDP affected life expectancy. A research hypothesis was proposed as well as three specific research questions: 
><br />*Hypothesis - Average life expectancy amongst countries is affected by socioeconomic factors such as early vaccination, GDP, and schooling.*
<br />Research Q1 - Do early life vaccinations affect average life expectancy in developing countries?
<br />Research Q2 - Does increased schooling positively correlated with increased life expectancy?
<br />Research Q3 - Are average life expectancy and infant deaths affected by GDP in developing countries?
<br />
<br />In order to answer these questions and test the hypothesis, a mulitple regressions were ran comparing variables listed in the hypothesis. All regressions showed mild to strong correlations between variables therefore supporting the research questions and hypothesis.
